# Digital Visualization

Welcome! This page serves as my working portolio that showcases various visualization/computational techniques while my personal website is under construction. You can download the .zip file and find the following projects inside:

**1. the Analects network** <br>
   I use <ins>interactive and animated social network visualization</ins> to show the drastic change of the Confucian circle, especially the increased reliance on disciples' connection to dukes and nobilities after Confucius died.

**2. Boko Haram attacks from 2009 to 2019** <br>
   This <ins>interactive and animated spatial analysis</ins> shows over the decade how the terrorist group expanded from the Nigeria-Niger-Chad border to the rest of Nigeria, before they were eventually pushed back. 

**3. Polarization, perceived negativity, and strength of partisanship in the American public** <br>
   Based on a 2014 midterm election dataset I have been working on, this <ins>3D visualization</ins> reflects key dimensions of public opinion in America back then. I also used the <ins>DBSCAN algorithm (an unsupervised machine learning algorithm)</ins> to detect potential clusters (2 clusters of voters were found).

**4. Which states are the wordiest in congress? Evidence from three decades' House floor speeches** <br>
   For this <ins>interactive</ins> plot, I extracted data from the daily congressional records over the three decades and plotted the average floor speech length of each state's representatives. One could either hover over the specific points or deselect/single out any particular state using the state abbreviation on the right.
